#Welcome to SEIGE, a chaotic RPG game where YOU play as the monster!
######AUTHOR'S NOTE:
I ask that you do not sell this project without consulting me first. In the event that people do this, I may take this project down. This game is supposed to be free to play and install, as well as free to modify. There is a definite reason why I have decided to make this game open source. PLEASE do not redistribute this and claim that you are the creator. You are not. The contributors to this project are the creators and without them this game would not be the same.

Speaking of the creators of this project, if you feel generous today, please think about leaving a donation via PayPal.
Each major contributor to the project's paypal is listed below:

I will be adding more donation links as more people contribute to SEIGE.
Thank you.
